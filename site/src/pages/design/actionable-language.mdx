# Actionable Language

---

### Buttons and Actions

- Button and Action labels should be clear and concise.
- Always begin the label with an actionable verb paired with a noun.
  - With the exception of common actions such as _"Close"_, or _"Cancel"_
- Always write the Button or Action label in title case, which means the first letter of each word should be capitalized.
- Avoid pronouns and unecessary articles such as _"your"_ or _"a"_.

# Typography

These guidelines are used to maintain readability and visual heirarchy.

### Typefaces

Matchbox's primary font is **Calibre**.

When Calibre is unavailable, our base font stack token, <Token name='font-family-sans'/>, defaults to native system font families. A monospace token, <Token name='font-family-monospace' />, is also available with system defaults.

<small>Calibre is visually small with a low baseline. When paired with other typefaces, size adjustments should be made to account for the difference in visual weight.</small>

### Size, Line Height, and Weight
Three font weights are used: normal **400**, medium **500**, and semibold **600**. While light **300** is available, it should be used sparingly.

Font sizes and line height tokens utilize the same naming convention as font weight values – sizes are three digit variants divisble by 100, with **400** acting as the normal and default variant.

These two sets of tokens are built to be paired with each other, for example: the size <Token name='font-size-800' /> should be paired with <Token name='line-height-800' />.

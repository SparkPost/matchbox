# Typography

These guidelines are used to maintain readability and visual heirarchy.

### Typefaces

Matchbox's primary font is **Calibre**.

When Calibre is unavailable, our base font stack token, <Token name='font-family-sans'/>, defaults to native system font families. A monospace token, <Token name='font-family-monospace' />, is also available with system defaults.

<small>
  Calibre is visually small with a low baseline. When paired with other
  typefaces, size adjustments should be made to account for the difference in
  visual weight.

### Size, Line Height, and Weight

Three font weights are used: _normal_, _medium_, and _semibold_. While _light_ is available, it should be used sparingly.

The font size and line height sets of tokens are designed to be paired with each other, for example: the size <Token name='font-size-800' /> should be paired with <Token name='line-height-800' />.

# Motion

Matchbox uses motion to provide guidance, clarity and focus to a UI.

Consistent movement improves an experience by visually describing connections and spatial relationships between states and views, drawing attention to importance or providing appropriate feedback.

### Principles

##### Intentional

Motion serves a purpose. Motion helps users reach their goals by guiding them through the complexity of an experience.

##### Intuitive

Motion should feel familiar and expected. Fluid, seamless motion make the experience feel natural, and mirrors objects in motion in the real world.

##### Contextual

Motion should tie back to the user's interaction. It provides appropriate feedback by aligning to the way an experience is used or manipulated.

### UI Animation Guidelines

#### Easing

**Describes changes in an object's velocity over time as it travels**

Easing reinforces movement by contributing to the naturalism and seamlessness of an experience. Objects move in a manner that is intuitive and behave as users expect them to.

###### Ease In

Starts slow and ends fast. Imagine dropping a ball to the ground. This easing curve is typically used to remove objects from view.

[example]

###### Ease Out

Starts fast and ends slow. Think of throwing a ball in the air and slowing down as it reaches its peak. This function is typically used to introduce objects to the view.

[example]

###### Ease In Out

Starts slow, speeds up, then ends slow. Think of a car accelerating and coming to a stop. This curve is typically used to move objects from one location to another.

[example]

#### Speed

**The amount of time it takes for a transition to take place**

Animation duration is closely related to how large the object in motion is, the distance it travels, and whether the object is entering, exiting, or transitioning.

###### Fast / Near / Exit

Use for objects that do not move, move a distance of less than 25% of the view, or are exiting the view.

[example]

###### Medium / Enter

Use for objects move a distance of less than 50% of the view, or are entering the view.

[example]

###### Slow / Far

Use for objects move a distance of more than 50% of the view, or are large in size.

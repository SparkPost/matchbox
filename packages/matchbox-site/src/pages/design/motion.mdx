# Motion

Matchbox uses motion to provide guidance, clarity and focus to a UI.

Consistent movement improves an experience by visually describing connections and spatial relationships between states and views, drawing attention to importance or providing appropriate feedback.

### Principles

<Box display={['block', 'block', 'block', 'flex']}>
  <Box flex="1" pr={['0', '0', '0', '200']} mb="600">
    <h6>Intentional</h6>
    <small>
      Animation should always serve a purpose. Motion helps users reach their
      goals by guiding them through the complexity of an experience.
    </small>
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1" px={['0', '0', '0', '200']} mb="600">
    <h6>Intuitive</h6>
    <small>
      Motion should feel familiar and expected. Fluid, seamless motion make the
      experience feel natural, and mirrors objects in motion in the real world.
    </small>
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1" pl={['0', '0', '0', '200']}>
    <h6>Contextual</h6>
    <small>
      Motion should tie back to the user's interaction. It provides appropriate
      feedback by aligning to the way an experience is used or manipulated.
    </small>
  </Box>

### UI Animation Concepts

#### Easing

_Describes changes in an object's velocity over time as it travels._

Easing reinforces movement by contributing to the naturalism and seamlessness of an experience. Objects move in a manner that is intuitive and behave as users expect them to.

##### Ease In

Starts slow and ends fast. Imagine dropping a ball to the ground. This
easing curve is typically used to remove objects from view.

<EaseIn />

<Box my="800"></Box>

##### Ease Out

Starts fast and ends slow. Think of throwing a ball in the air and slowing
down as it reaches its peak. This function is typically used to introduce
objects to the view.

<EaseOut />

<Box my="800"></Box>

##### Ease In Out

Starts slow, speeds up, then ends slow. Think of a car accelerating and
coming to a stop. This curve is typically used to move objects from one
location to another.

<EaseInOut />

#### Duration

_The amount of time it takes for a transition to take place_

Animation duration is closely related to how large the object in motion is, the distance it travels, and whether the object is entering, exiting, or transitioning.

<Box display={['block', 'block', 'block', 'flex']}>
  <Box flex="1" pr={['0', '0', '0', '200']} mb="600">
    <h6>Fast / Near / Exit</h6>
    <small>
      Use for objects that do not move, move a distance of less than 25% of the
      view, or are exiting the view.
    </small>
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1" pr={['0', '0', '0', '200']} mb="600">
    <h6>Medium / Enter</h6>
    <small>
      Use for objects move a distance of less than 50% of the view, or are
      entering the view.
    </small>
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1" pr={['0', '0', '0', '200']} mb="600">
    <h6>Slow / Far</h6>
    <small>
      Use for objects move a distance of more than 50% of the view, or are large
      in size.
    </small>
  </Box>
</Box>

<Speed />

### UI Animation Examples

##### Fade In and Out

The entrance of the snackbar in this example uses medium speed with ease out, while the exit uses a fast speed with ease in.

<EnterExit />

<Box my="800"></Box>

##### Fast Transitions

Fast transitions typically take place in small common interactions, think buttons, links, menu items, or anything that does not transform.

<FastInPlace />

<Box my="800"></Box>

##### Slow and Large

A large animation would use a longer duration, think of pages, empty states, or large overlays.

<Large />
